# Did not finish

Been working on this for 6 hours, now. I've got things to get ready for the
weekend, and I'm stumped (doesn't help that I went with a brute force attempt
to solve the example input).

I got the right answer for the Part 1 example, but given that the input I have
has 15 valves with unique flow rates, the possible number of permutations is
pretty high (15^15). I could get it down to 11^11 if I removed the rates that
are less than 10, but that might now solve it either, so...

Looking at the subreddit, other people have managed to solve it with much
smaller solutions, so I probably missed something.
